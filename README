Inlauncher is a simple app to open and close ipython notebook in a user-friendly way.

It is a tk-based python script.  However, to achieve its strength, you could check out the [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md) manual.  At the end, you could place the application at any place you want and run ipython notebook from that folder and close the ipython smoothly without using terminal.

# Demo

By double clicking the *gui.py* application, you start a tiny console to control your ipython notebook.
